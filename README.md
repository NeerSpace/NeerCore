## About

__Heyo bananas!__ üòéüçåüçå

NeerCore is a library for simplified writing of web applications based on ASP.NET 6. It integrates a popular set of core
libraries that are required for developing full-fledged apps, but they don't come out of the box in ASP.NET. NeerCore
can be used as shown in the examples in the official repository, or separately in parts that you need. You can also use
part of the code from the repository if you do not need to include "one more nuget package" or if your project is not
support the version of .NET on which NeerCore was created.

Thank you for using my developments, I hope they make your life easier! ;)
